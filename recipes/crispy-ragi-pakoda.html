    <h2>The Health Benefits of Ragi</h2>
    <p>
      The health benefits and nutrition offered by ragi are immense. Ragi is a
      remarkable source of protein and minerals and contains important amino
      acids. It has a high amount of calcium and potassium and is a great source
      of iron. Ragi contains tryptophan, an amino acid that reduces appetite.
      Ragi is known to relax the body naturally, and is thus beneficial in
      conditions of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
